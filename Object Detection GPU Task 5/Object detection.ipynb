In Approach 3, we'll demonstrate the benefits of research, expertise, and iteration with the caveat that you can use these networks and models without being their designer. The challenge faced by the designers of the network we'll use was **what is the most efficient and accurate way to map the input output pairings from out data?**\n",

    "The fact that we used a sliding window with non-overlapping grid squares means that it is very likely that some of our grid squares will only partially contain a dog and this can lead to misclassifications. However, as we increase the overlap in the grid squares we will rapidly increase the computation time for this sliding window approach. We can make up for this increase in computation by *batching* inputs, a strategy that takes advantage of the GPU's intrinsic strength of parallel processing.\n",
